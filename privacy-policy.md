# Privacy Policy for Pager
### Last updated: 21 January 2026
Pager (“the app”) is an Android application for browsing books, keeping a personal reading diary, writing reviews, and saving quotes. Your privacy matters, and this policy explains what data the app uses and how it is handled.
### 1. Data the app stores on your device  
   Pager stores the following information locally on your device only:  
   Books you add to your diary  
   Reviews you write (including ratings, spoiler flags, and visibility settings)  
   Quotes you save (including optional page numbers)  
   Dates associated with books and reviews  
   This data is stored in a local database on your device. It is not automatically uploaded or shared with the developer or third parties.  
### 2. Camera usage and text scanning  
   Pager includes an optional feature that allows you to take a photo of a book page and scan text to help save quotes.  
   The camera is only accessed when you choose to use the scan feature  
   Text recognition is performed on-device  
   Images are used only temporarily for text extraction  
   Photos are not uploaded, shared, or stored remotely by the app  
   If you do not grant camera permission, you can still add quotes manually.  
### 3. Network access  
   Pager uses an internet connection for features such as:  
   Searching for books using an online book information API  
   Downloading book cover images  
   The app does not send your personal diary content (reviews, quotes, ratings) to any server.  
### 4. Data sharing  
   Pager does not:  
   Sell your data  
   Share your personal data with third parties  
   Upload your reviews, quotes, or diary entries without your explicit action  
   Any future features involving online sharing will be clearly communicated and may require additional consent.  
### 5. Data retention and deletion  
   All data is stored locally on your device  
   You can delete individual books, reviews, and quotes within the app  
   Uninstalling the app or clearing its storage will remove all stored data  
### 6. Children’s privacy  
   Pager is not designed specifically for children and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.  
### 7. Security  
   Pager relies on Android’s built-in application sandboxing and storage protections to keep your data secure on your device.  
### 8. Changes to this policy  
   This Privacy Policy may be updated as Pager evolves. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
